ROI stands for Return on Investment and means the amount of money you get back relative to the amount of money you put into something. It is different to profit, which is simply the amount spent subtracted from the amount earned. ROI goes a step further and works out profit per the amount spent. This answers the question – how much profit can I earn per pound/dollar/euro etc spent."
